# Detailed outline of the tutorial

The HPCCarpentry workshop will be a full day (6-hour) workshop,
divided in four 90 minute sections.
Within each section,
there will be alternate 10-15 minute
live-coding demonstrations of a certain concept/procedure,
and 10-15 minute exercise/challenge sections.
Participants will be encouraged to work in teams
for the challenge sections.

The first half (3-hours) will focus on helping learners develo
a strong, but flexible mental model of the cluster structure,
and to understand
    * How to move data and programs to and from the cluster,
    * How to submit jobs to the cluster,
    * How to configure their environment,
    * Use existing software and set up their own software.

For the second half, learners will be presented with the following
scenarious:

> Jun is a researcher working on tracking the spread of disease by surveying newspaper
articles as far back as 1900. He has acquired the text of all of these newspapers and has
read the literature on natural language processing approaches for mining this data
and has a Python script from a colleague where he can look for particular words.
He knows he wants to apply these techniques to the newspaper corpus,
but doesn’t know how to run the program and his local computer doesn’t
have the required computational power, even if he could run the program.
He’s heard that he should be able to run the analysis on his university’s
HPC, but he doesn’t know where to start. He needs to understand what remote
computing is, how to log on to the HPC, how to get his data on the HPC,
run analyses there and get his analysis results back on to his own computer. 

> Nelle is a Ph.D. student working on studying [something].
As part of this work, she has to run several simulations of [something].
Her program takes several hours to run.
She has proflied her program and found out that a tight inner loop
takes 95% of the time, etc.
