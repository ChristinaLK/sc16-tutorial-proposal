# Description of hands-on demos/exercises

## Resources

This tutorial requires access to a large scale computing system that 
supports remote login and uses a batch scheduler.  We will have temporary 
accounts created for all partipants on the Oklahoma State University
computing cluster for this purpose.  We are also applying for an 
allocation on XSEDE which, if granted, will complement the resources 
available through Oklahoma State.  

Participants will need to bring their own laptop or portable computing 
device that can use WiFi.  The tutorial will require using 
a bash shell (or similar tool); installation instructions will be part of 
the workshop materials.  

## Approach

The pedagogical approach of this workshop will be modeled on that of 
the Software and Data Carpentry communities, which contains multiple 
interactive components.  These components are as follows: 

### Live Coding

The content will be presented through a combination of lecturing 
and live coding in front of tutorial participants.  Presenters will 
both talk about HPC concepts as described in the outline, and 
demonstrate them in front of participants, with the expectation that 
participants are able to run the same commands as the presenter, so they 
are prepared for independent exercises.  

> **Example: Logging onto a large-scale computing system**
> 
> Presenter draws a diagram of a user's local computer and the 
> login node of a remote computing system, and describes what is 
> happening when users log in.  She then demonstrates 
> logging into the provided cluster using the "ssh" command; all participants
> use the same command to log in to the same cluster.  

### Exercises

In addition to the content presentation, the tutorial will contain 
regular exercises where participants are expected to work individually 
or in groups on a set of challenges.  

> **Example: Submitting jobs to a batch scheduler**
> 
> Taking a job submission file, created during the preceeding live 
> coding portion of the workshop, participants will modify the submission file
> to use a different data file, submit to a different partition, 
> and request a different amount of memory.  

### Support

Throughout the workshop, participants will be provided with two 
colors of sticky 
notes to serve as a visual indicator of progress.  
When presenters are not leading a session, they will circulate 
among participants to answer questions or address immediate issues.
