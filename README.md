# Proposal requirements

Please see the [call for tutorials](https://github.com/swcarpentry/hpc-novice/files/210155/sc16-tutorials-call.pdf)
for all information related to the submission.
Here is the section about the requirements:

A successful proposal will clearly describe (in English) the tutorial topic,
the target audience, why it is of relevance to that audience,
and the content, schedule, and organization of the tutorial in a detailed course outline.
The “detailed course outline” is the most critical part of the submission.
To better understand the content and format of a submission,
we encourage potential submitters to view a sample submission form well before the submission deadline
by visiting http://submissions. supercomputing.org, and clicking on the “sample submission forms” link.

The proposal file should contain the following sections, each beginning on a separate page:

1. [Abstract](abstract.md) - 200 words maximum
2. [Description](description.md) - 2 pages maximum
* General description of tutorial content;
* Targeted audience (researchers, students, developers, practitioners, etc.)
* Why the topic is relevant to SC16 attendees
* If the tutorial has a state of the practice component, a clear description of what and how those
parts involve state of the practice
* Content level (% beginner, % intermediate, % advanced);
* Audience prerequisites;
* If there are multiple presenters, how presenters will ensure presentations form a cohesive whole
as opposed to a sequence of disparate talks; and
* If your tutorial has been presented previously, a list of when and where it has been presented and
how it will be updated for SC16
3. [Detailed course outline](outline.md) - 1 page maximum
4. [Description of hand on demos/exercises](hands-on.md)
5. Curriculum vitae for each presenter (2-page maximum each). Each should include a list of tutorials/courses
the presenter has taught.
