# Abstract

This is a proposal to present the first High Performance Computing Carpentry (HPC Carpentry) workshop
at Supercomputing 2016.
Our vision for the HPC Carpentry workshop is a full-day (6 hour) workshop that teaches novice users
the skills necessary to interact with high-performance computing (HPC) and high-throughput computing (HTC) resources
and to conceptualize, develop and optimize workflows on them.
The HPC Carpentry effort stems from the Software Carpentry workshop model,
which is aimed at teaching researchers across a broad range of disciplines
"basic lab skills for research computing".
We are also inspired by the success of the Data Carpentry project in specializing that model
to better serve specific audiences in data science.
Our hope is that HPC Carpentry becomes a fixture at Supercomputing conferences,
serving not only as *the* entry-level workshop targeted at novices offered at Supercomputing,
[NOTE: compare to the role of SWC/DC at PyCon/SciPy?]
but also as a platform for discussion about the best practices, tools and concepts in HPC training.
